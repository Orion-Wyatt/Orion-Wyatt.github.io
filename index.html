                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website.</p>
                <p>Here you'll be able to find information on me. Such as hobbies and experience.</p>
                <p>You'll also find my work history here as well.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Named Orion, aged 18 (Since the year 2022), I’m currently a student in the college known as Stamford College. In my current stage of education, I am studying the subject of ICT, a subject I’ve been interested in for a while now.</p>
                <p>In-person, typically, I’m rather quiet, being observant rather than social. Though, at times, I can also be rather sociable. But that’s typically only with people I’ve been around enough to be comfortable with. Despite this, I can work with others, and help out, and over time, as I get to know the people I’m around I’ll become more talkative.</p>
                <p>If given a task I often try to get it done, turning to any available tool I have if I were to get stuck in achieving the required outcome. Though not afraid to show honesty if I’m not able to achieve what’s wanted.</p>
